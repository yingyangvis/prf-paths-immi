If the government does not support the member for Melbourne's amendment, it means that the government's actions of some 10 weeks ago were at best hollow and at worst misleading. So I hope that the government will come in here and support this amendment and that this amendment will succeed.",

I'll say that again: as of March 2022, 1,512 people were held in immigration detention facilities in Australia. There were a further 563 people living in community detention and 10,993 people, so-called illegal maritime arrivals, living in the community after being granted bridging visas. Moreover, there are still 200 asylum seekers in offshore detention, which is effectively imprisonment. Even though, at face value, the people on, say, Nauru are free to go about their lives in that tiny country, it's such a tiny island it's effectively a gulag—no better than the gulags on the Thames a couple of hundred years ago. The average time for people to be held in detention facilities is 700 days. In fact there are some who have been held in offshore detention for over nine years.

Nor will I support any opposition amendment that would restrict offshore processing to countries that are a signatory to the refugee convention. I laboured with this issue about the possibility of the opposition bringing on an amendment that would say that Australia can send asylum seekers only to countries that are signatories to the refugee convention. For a long time I did see the value in supporting such an amendment, because if we are going to have offshore processing, let us at least send people to countries that have some safeguards in place—and Malaysia is not one. But in the end I have decided that I will not support such an amendment for fear that it would create the circumstances in which the government and the opposition might work together to continue offshore processing in a place such as Manus Island, where I do worry that the government's and the opposition's interests overlap.",

This was one of the reasons I was deeply disappointed by Labor's response to constituents regarding previous versions of this bill, where Labor claimed it was, 'Seeking to dictate to our regional neighbours how to manage asylum seeker populations' and 'Commits regional nations to actions without their consent or engagement'. What a load of rubbish! If Labor had bothered to read the bill, they'd see that a fundamental principle of APASS is cooperation and respect for the sovereignty of each member country as well as being alert to the difficulties and priorities of refugee protection for each country involved. No wonder the community is confused about Labor's asylum seeker policy when Labor criticises the government's policy despite helping create it and promising to maintain it and then turns around and criticises the viable APASS alternative.",

I take this opportunity to remind honourable members of that bill, because it just goes to show that there are viable alternatives to the way we detain people in this country. That bill, if it were ever to become law, would abolish unlawful mandatory detention of asylum seekers, refugees and noncitizens. By the way, in doing so, it would have the effect of ending offshore detention. I do note that in last night's budget even more money is being thrown at increasing the capacity of the Christmas Island detention facility. How many billions of dollars after billions of dollars is this country going to throw at offshore detention before we realise we have to find better and more humane—and lawful, in international law—ways of dealing with irregular immigration?",

If they make their appeal and the original security assessment is upheld, then Australia is quite within its rights as a signatory to the refugee convention to prohibit those people from entering the community.",

The issue is not whether or not there could be a very small number of people who are genuine security risks in this country. The issue today really is one about fairness and openness. If we accept that all people are equal, and if we accept that it is a fundamental basis of our system that all people should have the right to appeal an adverse finding against them, to challenge an adverse assessment, then why on earth do we have this situation in Australia where an Australian citizen who receives an adverse security assessment is entitled to make an appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal but an asylum seeker is not? The bottom line is that in our law an asylum seeker is regarded as a second-class human being who somehow is inferior and should have fewer rights than an Australian citizen. That is wrong, and this bill would remedy that by removing that carve-out from asylum seekers from the relevant part of the ASIO Act.",

There is no way in the world that a majority of Australians support the live animal export trade.

My concern to try and get such a safety net built into the member for Lyne's bill was not without good reason.

That is probably just the tip of the iceberg, because we can reasonably assume that many more boats have sunk without even coming to the attention of the authorities, let alone being subject to any sort of rescue attempt. In fact, probably over a thousand asylum seekers have lost their lives in recent years on the sea leg between transit countries, Indonesia in particular, and Australia. That is a thousand or more dreams of a better life extinguished—bodies smashed against the already bloodstained rocks, last breaths gasped in a frenzied panic as parents struggled to save their children from their watery graves.",

I certainly support this, and I call on all honourable members to support the Time for a Home campaign. Let's get everyone out of detention before World Refugee Day in June 2021.

When they were in government, they supported Nauru. They supported Nauru, and it was not a signatory to the UN. But now they will not vote for legislation—and this motion is to bring on a bill, to have legislation voted on, which is consistent with their policy but which they show their relentless negativity in opposing. This suspension should be rejected because the day-after-day moving of suspension motions has reduced this process to a farce. ",

The world said: ‘Never again.’ By adopting the refugee convention the world said that humanity is better than that, that we are part of a global community and that we do have a responsibility to stop that occurring again. Of course, Nauru is not a signatory to the 1951 convention, which is one of the reasons why that country has been chosen to house detainees.

It will be whether or not executive government should have the power to transfer asylum seekers to third countries. I am in favour of that.",

Clearly, from those UNHCR statistics push factors are on the rise. On the question of assessing domestic policy settings and the implications of those domestic policy settings on the number of arrivals, I refer her to the analysis of her own colleague the member for Kooyong. Maybe when question time is at its conclusion she can go and have a cup of tea with him and talk this through with him in detail.

Those costs were met by the former Howard government—in the region of hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars—in order to fund the so-called Pacific solution. We have taken a different approach but we have maintained mandatory detention. Yes, it does cost money, but it is the right policy for this country and, as a result, we will continue to fund it. I am not sure whether the member, in asking his question, is suddenly of the view that mandatory detention should be abandoned as a policy. I know that he has flipped and flopped in many directions on immigration policy since the last election, but mandatory detention remains the policy of this government and consequently we will fund it.",

They were announced by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. As I said yesterday, as the minister for immigration has said today and as I am happy to reiterate, obviously the department of immigration, from time to time working with the Department of Defence, considers contingencies and options for asylum seeker accommodation. There is nothing new in this. Similar processes used to happen under the previous government, the Howard government. I would remind the member, for example, that the Howard government actually dealt with the facility at Christmas Island as a contingency. So this sort of planning goes on, work goes on, and that work has been happening in the department of immigration with, from time to time as it impacts on defence facilities, the Department of Defence. The minister for immigration made an announcement on 17 September about immigration facilities. There are some implications for the facility the member refers to and they are now on the public record.",

From their interjections the opposition seem either to not understand this or to be engaged in grand scepticism about it. Can I suggest to them that, if they are so sceptical about this approach, they choose to seek some guidance from a former Liberal prime minister, Malcolm Fraser, who can tell them a bit about irregular people movements, a regional framework and regional processing. I suggest they make that call on the phone.",

The federal budget of 2010 funded a detention centre at Curtin with a capacity of 1,200 places. Less than 1,200 persons were initially moved in there. However, of course the relevant department took the prudent steps in designing the centre and putting the infrastructure in place so that the centre could reach its full capacity efficiently. When Minister Bowen became minister, he reviewed the work that had occurred at Curtin and decided to increase the numbers at Curtin to 1,200. That was the first time the department had been instructed to make the arrangements for staffing—and the detention centre manager, Serco, to move more people into the Curtin site. Minister Bowen made it clear in the announcement on 17 September that work had been underway to enable the decision for the extra 600 people to be moved in.",

        "text": "Of course, the logical flaw contained in the question is this. First of all, when it comes to any asylum seeker anywhere, there is the whole question of assessment and processing of the individual. Secondly, what happens once processing occurs is that if a person has been determined not to be a bona fide refugee in one part of the world or another they are sent back to the country from which they came. As I informed the House yesterday in terms of an arrival of a boatload of some 50 individuals back in April, two thirds of those were sent back to Sri Lanka in the course of the last week or so. That is normal process. Thirdly, in the case of the identification of those who do have bona fide refugee status, what then occurs when it comes to offshore processing in the case of Indonesia is that negotiations occur with resettlement countries, as has been the practice since time immemorial. Fourthly, consistent with the arrival of refugees in this country or any other country, the normal provision of social services applies. That is the law and that is how it has been for a long, long time.",

Unfortunately, this claim does not stand up when compared with the global figures of the time. They are as follows. The Liberal Party need to reflect on the fact that around the world we saw decreases in the arrival of asylum seekers across this period. Between 2001 and 2003, the number of Iraqis claiming asylum worldwide dropped from 52,000 to 27,000—a drop of 48 per cent. Between 2001 and 2003, the number of Afghans claiming asylum globally dropped from 50,000 to 14,000—a decrease of 73 per cent. Between 2001 and 2003, the number of Sri Lankans claiming asylum globally dropped from 14,000 to 5,600—a decrease of 61 per cent.",

Furthermore, I would draw the honourable member’s attention to the fact that within the next couple of weeks the minister and myself will be attending the Bali processing meeting in Bali with the Indonesian foreign minister and with foreign ministers and representatives from across the region. That is the proper mechanism through which we determine a regional response to what is a problem not just for the Australian nation, not just for the wider region but in fact for the entire world.",

These policies had been controversial; they had been, from time to time, amended and refined—but they had also been effective.

Was the Prime Minister aware of this increase prior to his decision to soften Australia’s border protection laws in August 2008?",

I remind the Prime Minister of this as Australians watch the television footage of the conditions at the Tanjung Pinang detention centre on Bintan Island.

The Prime Minister may think he can spin his way out of his problems here in the House, but the real challenge is on our borders. We used to have a border protection policy that sought to achieve—and did achieve—two goals: firstly, the compassionate and fair reception and treatment of refugees in accordance with the UN convention and, secondly, the security of our borders and ensuring that as far as possible people-smuggling was stamped out and there were no unauthorised arrivals. Both of those goals were achieved, and the record is there. From 2002-03 until the change in the border protection policies by this government last year, there was, relative to the current situation, a very, very small number of arrivals—in some years zero and in other years only a few boats.

When the Howard government was faced with a growing tide of asylum seekers arriving by boat, it took hard decisions to stop the flow. In 2001-02 there were 19 boats, with 3,039 people on board. The following year no boats arrived. Over the next five years there were a total of 18 boats, carrying 301 people. On average 60 asylum seekers arrived by boat each year. In just over a year, since the Rudd government began dismantling the immigration policies of the Howard government, we have, as I remind the House, had 41 boats arrive, carrying nearly 2,000 people. If the object of policy is to prevent and discourage these unauthorised maritime arrivals, this enormous upsurge in arrivals must be a failure of policy. Of that there can be no question.",

That makes perfect sense. People smugglers are demanding thousands of dollars—this is a large sum even by Australian standards, let alone by the standards of desperate people, whether they come from Afghanistan, Iraq or Sri Lanka—so they have to be able to promise with credibility that they can deliver residency in Australia. So, plainly, that is a marketing tool. On 22 April, Indonesia’s Ambassador to Australia said that he thought the traffickers may use this—that is, the government’s change in policies—as a trial to organise more flows of refugees, because they get more money for it. We saw the UNHCR’s regional representative, Richard Towle, confirming that Australia’s changed immigration policies are a marketing tool for people smugglers. On 16 October, he said:",

And if Labor has its way, it will do it again. We know the Leader of the Opposition is giving in again to the left of his party just as Kevin Rudd did in 2008 and 2009. He talks about a unity ticket, he talks about being tough on borders. The fact is, he trivialises it—talking about people smuggling as tourism.

I want to note in that context that that was effectively admitted by the immigration minister, Mr Dutton, who, in a media release less than two weeks ago, admitted that people smugglers are still targeting this country. We were told as a people that this cruel and inhumane policy, based on punitive, indefinite detention offshore and boat turn-backs, would actually deal with the issue of people putting their lives at risk at sea—that is, people seeking asylum—and also would smash the business model of the people smugglers. Well, neither of those things have come to pass. In other words, all the cruelty, all the inhumanity and all the people we are breaking on Manus and Nauru is for naught. This is a public policy failure almost without precedent in our country's history.",

This legislation seeks to discriminate against a particular cohort who are described as transitory persons who were at least 18 years of age and who were taken to a regional processing country after 19 July 2013.

One of the things he did in that speech was urge the Labor Party to actually, finally, do something for the relatively very small number of people who are still stranded in Papua New Guinea and Nauru—fewer than 150 people who are, as I've said, about to clock up a decade in offshore detention. And he asked the Labor Party a question in his speech. He said, 'What are you scared of?' I think that's a question the Labor Party needs to answer. What is the Labor Party scared of? Any moral person who looks at the last 10 years of the lives of the fewer than 150 people still in exile in either Papua New Guinea or Nauru is going to say, 'Enough is enough.'

But what happened is that PNG naval personnel, holding alcoholic drinks, started by throwing rocks and actually successfully hitting some of the detainees.

Nobody in this place would like to make that choice, but it is a stark reality that Australia's offshore processing, offshore detention and Operation Sovereign Borders policy framework is not only creating humanitarian calamities and costing lives, liberty, freedom and mental and physical health but also ripping families apart and destroying families. Peter Dutton needs to intervene here, and he needs to intervene now.",

Not all of us were convinced about asylum seekers, but we could not help ourselves, because down in Tasmania we welcome strangers. So, in the locals went, carrying gifts of beanies and food.

Minister, the simple fact remains that your government cut many thousands of people seeking asylum off the Status Resolution Support Services program, which left them with no income support at all from government. What I'm hearing from you this evening is that you have no intention of providing income support for those people. They're losing their jobs too. What are they supposed to do? They are going to lose their homes. Do you expect them to be thrown out on the street? It's beyond belief, having cut them off the SRSS a few years ago and effectively forcing them into work—whatever they could get. Are they now to be left with no income at all and face homelessness and destitution, as well as their families and their children? It's cruel and callous, and quite frankly it beggars belief.",

It is literally a life or death debate. There are literally lives at very real risk based on the decisions that we make today. Without medevac, the transfer of desperately ill and sick people who have been in Australia's offshore detention regime for coming on to seven years now—the overwhelmingly majority of whom have significant and serious physical and/or mental health problems—will ultimately be determined by the minister. Medevac placed those decisions where they ought to be in a civilised society, which is in the hands of doctors. That is what we are debating.",

So, firstly, does that capacity exist under this amendment?

This act introduced new powers to refuse or cancel visas on character grounds.

It has been designed to break people, and break people it has. It has the express and admitted intent of deterring other people from seeking asylum. It's like the old medieval practice of impaling corpses on the walls of cities to dissuade other desperates from trying to enter. Here we are, in the early to middle 21st century, engaged in that kind of medieval barbarism.",

Last year he was caught making a bigoted remark about Cape York before what he thought was a hilarious joke about Pacific Islanders losing their homes to rising sea levels. Since becoming minister, Mr Dutton infamously said that refugees are 'illiterate and innumerate' and would be stealing Australian jobs. He then doubled down on his hate speech by despicably trying to link refugees to terrorist attacks in Turkey and France. Let us call out Mr Dutton's remarks for what they are: turning your back on an apology to the stolen generation is bigotry; joking about 'Cape York time' is, at the very least, casual racism; calling refugees 'illiterate and innumerate' job thieves is xenophobia; and linking asylum seekers to terrorism is divisive bigotry that should have stopped over 50 years ago. But rather than demoting or disendorsing Mr Dutton for his repeated public expressions of racism, bigotry and xenophobia, Mr Turnbull has made him his immigration minister. Instead of lancing the boil of racism and bigotry, Mr Turnbull has allowed it to take root at the very heart of the Liberal Party.",

They've militarised our borders. They've advertised their cruelty for the world to see, with slogans that have been in aped by far-Right nationalists in Europe. They've turned around people fleeing persecution and, in some cases, turned them straight back into the hands of the regimes and the persecution they were fleeing. They have destroyed thousands of lives in offshore detention, an appalling, bloody policy that has the full support of both major parties in this place.

I want to make a couple of points. Firstly, it was good to see this parliament come together to condemn Senator Anning, but what Senator Anning said does not happen in isolation. This government has been sleep-walking Australia down this path for a long time now, demonising African people in Melbourne and joining with the Labor Party in a discriminatory migration policy which locks up only people with brown and black skins in places like Manus Island and Nauru. We have to see Senator Anning's comments in that context. I say very clearly that, if the Labor and Liberal parties had not been joining in discriminatory migration, those comments could not have been made.",

There are no white people locked up on Manus Island or Nauru. We have a bipartisan policy of banishing people of different races and cultures who arrive by boat to island prison camps where they are tortured and deprived of basic liberties.",

Of course, Labor chose to vote with all of those people to ensure that some migrants—recent arrivals in this country—would be denied access to parts of the social security safety net for four years. It was a piece of legislation that was incredibly punitive on migrants, who are one of the most vulnerable cohorts in our community. Why Labor would want to make migration policy with people like Senator Hanson and Senator Anning is actually for them to explain. It's worth reminding the chamber that, in fact, last week Senator Hanson rose to her feet and said she was very proud of the Labor Party for voting with her and Senator Anning and the coalition to do over migrants and make life more difficult for migrants in this country.",

That is why we have a refugee convention: safety and security for people who need it. But no! We will send them to a war zone. We will send them to Nauru to live in tents with a lack of access to medical facilities.",

As a consequence of that, he died in a hospital in Brisbane. He represents everything that is wrong with our detention centre network. He was a young man and he committed no crime. He was a man who, under international convention, was found to be a genuine refugee. And yet the Australian government's response was to detain this man indefinitely, with no prospect of him being able to enjoy the freedom and liberties that he so desperately fought to find. Of course, the response from the Prime Minister was cruel. It was heartless: to suggest that the nation should not be 'misty-eyed' at the death of a young man who has died as a direct result of Australia's policies of offshore detention. It shows a man who has become so heartless in his role—so completely disconnected from what it means to offer a human response to a problem countries right around the world are facing.",

This is a case of correlation versus causality. Let us be very clear about what the difference is. Just because people are in government does not mean that changes in the numbers of boat arrivals can be sheeted home to their policies. The movement of people across the world is a consequence of a complex number of factors that are outside of the control of the Australian government.",

You have to make the conditions as harsh and as cruel and as brutal as the conditions in which people have fled. Stopping the boats is easy. The question is: at what price?

If we want to address the issue of good order, if we want to ensure that our detention centre facilities are somewhere where we do not see the disturbances that this government is keen to highlight, how about we do something about those basic human living conditions? Instead of doing that, this government does what it always does, it takes the easy option. It tries to stoke fear and division within the community. It seeks to sanction a culture of excessive force within our detention centre network. And it gives and grants even more power to people who have already demonstrated that they are unable to behave responsibly with the power that they have, and it grants them more punitive power over a group of vulnerable people.",

Today has been a pretty big day for us. It has been pretty emotional. It has been quite intense. We have dealt with a number of issues. This morning the government had not even flagged that this legislation would come before the Senate. This morning the government wanted us to deal purely with Mr Oakeshott's bill and the withholding tax legislation. Somehow during the morning the government decided that what it had agreed to previously—not rushing this legislation through the parliament—somehow could now be forgotten. So here we are, 8.30 at night at the end of a very long sitting week, and we are talking about an important piece of legislation that affects some of the most vulnerable people in our country. I guess the government is hoping that this can simply be rushed through and brushed under the carpet, with no-one noticing because there is a big media storm over the asylum seeker issue.",

The circumstances in their home towns in Afghanistan has changed a lot in the last four or five years. Often the safety of family members has been impacted throughout that time—those who remained behind. In fact, we continue to hear, sadly, on a very regular basis that asylum seekers who are living here in Australia and waiting for their refugee claims even to be started are getting awful phone calls or notices from home that their sons, daughters, mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters or family members have been targeted and killed by the Taliban throughout that process, over that long period of time that they have been waiting to get their refugee claim sorted and, of course, for family reunion.",

Limiting the ability to access judicial review to people who have been detained for at least 12 months is simply illogical if the point is to try and eliminate suffering and trauma and to decrease the numbers of people who continue to be held unlawfully.",

We were told 20 years ago that we needed mandatory detention to deter people from coming to Australia by boat, and as conditions got worse in our region for refugees it did not deter people. We were told by John Howard that we needed not just mandatory detention but we needed temporary protection visas to deter people seeking protection coming here by boat. Under those temporary protection visas we stripped away their family reunion rights, their rights to access medical services, their rights to work, their rights to even volunteer. They were the restrictions under the coalition's temporary protection visas. Did that deter people from coming here by the only means possible that they had, and that was by boat? No, it did not. In fact, as my colleague Senator Milne has pointed out, it forced more women and children onto boats. That policy is responsible for the loss of life at sea.",

I guess that gets to the heart of the problem: the coalition do not believe we should have refugees in Australia. They do not believe that we should have a compassionate approach. If they did, they would understand that those people seeking asylum are not illegal. Terms like ‘illegal’ are not only offensive but absolutely inaccurate. It is actually not illegal to arrive in Australia and seek asylum and refuge. I find it incredibly distressing and unfortunate that some people continue to use this to exploit desperate asylum seekers for their own political advantage.

We oppose this bill as it hands unprecedented power to the minister of the day to cancel and refuse a person's visa, denies procedural fairness, risks breaching fundamental human rights and will result in people being subjected to indefinite detention. The Minister for Immigration and Border Protection currently possesses wide-ranging powers to refuse and cancel visas. Why on earth he thinks he needs more powers is beyond me. These powers enable the minister to regulate noncitizens in Australia and to protect the Australian community from any risk that may be posed—these are powers that the minister already has. This bill seeks to significantly and unnecessarily expand the powers the minister currently has.",

I know, when we have in the past had debates around the issue of how Australia deals with and manages the flow of asylum seekers and what we do to help offer protection to refugees, often the level of debate in this place is very low. Often it becomes all about the politics of the issue rather than about understanding the fate of the people whom we are incarcerating in detention. There will be discussion, of course, as to how people arrived. We know that, under this government, even the terminology that is used in relation to how those asking for our help arrive here is negative: all government officials have been directed to refer to them as 'illegal'. In fact, they are not illegal at all. They are asylum seekers. They are people who are asking for refuge. They are not illegal. There is nothing in Australian law that says they are illegal—nothing but a directive from the immigration minister.",

In fact, the Greens have been at the forefront of pushing and lobbying for the removal of the 45-day rule, so there is no way that we would support the coalition’s motion.

While there are reports that border security will receive a boost of up to $500 million in tonight’s budget to combat people smuggling, I hope that we also see an increase in our commitment to providing humanitarian visas and humanitarian aid.",

In fact, if you include this year and the forward estimates, it is costing $10 billion to detain children and their families on Manus Island, in inhumane conditions, damaging them for the rest of their lives—$10 billion. There is of course no media access to these detention centres, because the government do not want the Australian people to see how badly we are treating our fellow human beings.

They have no way of challenging their detention and, indeed, they never know when their 'sentence' will end, because it is administrative detention that these men, women and children are subjected to. They are subjected to a mandatory detention system that is funded by Australian taxpayers and which wastes in the vicinity of $3 billion.

If we espouse to be leaders in the global community, we need to take some responsibility for helping those desperate people around the world as well. Simply pushing them back out to sea and saying it is not our problem is just not good enough.",

He had been in and out of detention, including on Christmas Island, for five years. He had attempted to take his own life previously and he was in a very distraught situation. This man came to Australia asking for help and protection. He was tortured severely when he was in Iran and Australia recognised that he had a legitimate claim for protection—and yet we did the very opposite. We did not look after him. We failed him in the most fundamental way and that resulted in his death over the weekend.",

The liability includes the cost of transporting the person to and from an immigration detention centre, the cost for each day the person spent in detention and, under section 211, the cost of removal from Australia if the detainee’s visa application is refused and they are subsequently deported. Under the act as it currently stands, each detainee is legally required to repay the Australian government the cost of their detention unless the debt is specifically waived or written off. The policy has long been seen by human rights and refugee activists as implicitly contravening international law and the spirit of the 1951 refugee convention. It has also undermined Australia’s ability to raise genuine concerns as to how other countries are treating or discriminating against refugees arriving in those countries.",

In 1999, when temporary protection visas were first introduced, they did not stop the flow of asylum seekers coming here by boat; in fact they had the reverse effect. In the two years prior to temporary protection visas being introduced, 1,078 people arrived by boat. In the two years after temporary protection visas were introduced, that number went to over 8,000—eight times as many people came by boat after the Howard government introduced temporary protection visas.

There would need to be substantial amendments made to this bill if it were to proceed. Six of the seven schedules would need to be deleted and the remaining schedule would need to have a genuine pathway to permanency, so that if people are found to be refugees—after all this time they have spent in detention, all this time they have been left dumped in the community—they should be able to stay, work, pay their taxes and send their kids to school. It is simply asking for a fair go and for people to be treated with dignity and respect. As this bill stands none of that is in here. I strongly urge this place to vote it down at the second reading.",

Every piece of migration legislation or regulation that has come before this place since this government took office a year ago has been to punish those who are most vulnerable—to punish refugees and asylum seekers. Rather than dealing with the administrative issues in a humane way, this government has again used it as an opportunity to kick refugees at a moment when applications are on foot.

The bill confers excessive immunities and powers upon authorised officers, without adequate safeguards. The government have not been able to control the behaviour of people who work within these facilities already. Just this year, questions at Senate estimates have revealed that, in the three months between February and May this year, there were 15 sexual assaults inside the detention network, two involving children, and 259 assaults of a non-sexual nature, 11 involving children. There have also been numerous well-publicised incidents of guards who have physically assaulted and abused asylum seekers within their care on both Manus Island and Nauru. If the government cannot control things as it is, if they cannot control the appropriate behaviour of staff as it is, then why on earth should we be asked to trust that giving officers in these places even more excessive powers would be acceptable?",

It is going to be very difficult, I believe, to have a successful transition between the immigration detention centres, the residential housing facilities and the transit accommodation. It is hard to believe that this, as well as the need to coordinate with the department, will result in good-quality care, when we know already that just dealing with one private operator and the department causes problems from time to time.",

The minister has argued that it creates a rapid process for asylum seekers who will be assessed under this caseload of 30,000. In reality, what this will do is strip away people's ability to appeal decisions and to ensure that the correct information about their cases is what is being used to make their assessments. It strips their ability to have their cases reviewed by the Refugee Review Tribunal. These amendments are all about the government trying to make it as hard as possible for somebody to be found to be a genuine refugee.",

That is why we will propose a number of amendments in the committee stage. I do not agree with offshore processing; I do not agree that the 'do whatever it takes' attitude means locking children up in an island prison indefinitely. I do not agree that keeping people in squalid conditions in the vain hope that they will give up on seeking protection and just go home to a war zone to face their torturers is what we should be doing. I do not agree that Australia should just legislate away our legal, international and moral obligations and responsibilities. I do not agree with any of those things—but these hellholes exist.",

All of the seven principles, bar one, which was keeping mandatory detention, that the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship announced last year have gone out the window—because we are in the lead-up to an election. It is totally shameful. If you are going to change your policies, be gutless and spineless, and not stand up for what is right, at least be honest about it and stop pretending you are otherwise.",

This government has all of this so backwards. There are many, many concerning points in relation to this government's direction, but one of the last things I want to mention—which is really important in relation to this Border Force legislation—is around the issue of secrecy. This government is obsessed with covering up and keeping both the Australian people and, indeed, the parliament in the dark with what is going on inside their Border Force operations. These bills will further entrench the unjustified and dangerous culture of secrecy of the department of immigration. This is yet another example of the government's eagerness to compromise the basic principle of transparent government in the name of national security.",

Of course, things like family reunion, as we have heard already tonight, are not included in this piece of legislation. All we see is a bill riddled with a grab for power by the immigration minister in order to pick and choose who he wants to come to this country and who he does not—not based on the refugee convention, not based on what Australia's obligations are and not based on need but based on who Mr Morrison, the immigration minister, wants to allow into this country and who he does not.

I do not agree with the Greens very often—and there are still many, many, many areas where we are in wild disagreement—but I will say one thing about the Greens that I cannot say about those opposite on any measure, and that is that the Greens are at least consistent. In their appalling views about border protection policy they were at least consistent. The Labor Party flipped and flopped and went all over the place—and they flip and flop to this day. But the Greens were at least consistent—and I consistently disagreed with them. On this measure, the Greens have simply acted in accordance with the convictions that they held back in 2007.",

To live alongside this virus, reopen our economies, bring down our internal borders and return our lives to as normal as possible, we must keep to the staples of successful containment and suppression of the virus: strong international border protection and quarantine measures; rigorous testing and tracing capabilities; an ability to respond decisively to localised outbreaks and isolate hotspots appropriately defined without shutting down our economy; and consistent hygiene and social distancing behaviours, including wearing a mask when required and, if you're sick, staying at home and getting tested.",

I refer to data released by the UK Home Office, which tracks 32 Western countries. The data showed that in the UK asylum applications actually dropped by six per cent. Interestingly, in the last quarter of 2009, they actually fell by 30 per cent compared to the last quarter of 2008. Why do I make reference to the UK? Because, as with Australia, the Afghan population makes up a reasonable number of those who are seeking asylum in the UK, so they have similar challenges. Their experience has been one of declining applications rather than increasing applications.",

It is because, when it comes to the budget that this government needs to pay for its border failures, it has run out of money.

Before we leave this place there is the opportunity to pass a bill that reflects that consensus and gives the government the protections and the powers to restore and strengthen control on our borders—to ensure that our borders are strong, uncompromised and unweakened by the continuation of the policies that we have seen since the proven measures of the Howard government were disestablished. I call on those opposite to allow that bill to be considered. ",

A few weeks ago, I made the point that the government's lack of guidelines and processes around their community release program needed to be addressed—it does need to be addressed and it still needs to be addressed. This government will not address it. Their policy now on community release is 'out of sight, out of mind'. Their policy on community release is 'no care, no responsibility'. So we have seen every last brick in John Howard's wall of border protection knocked down by this government. What has been the result of all this?",

It will be proven in its implementation. Under this government, everything costs more, takes longer and is less effective. So far offshore processing seems to be proving that point again.

This is not terribly surprising because the Australian people lost confidence in this government a long time ago—and not only on this issue but on all of the issues we have seen come before this place, most significantly demonstrated yesterday as they patted themselves on the back as they introduced the world's largest carbon tax on the Australian people.",

The proven deterrent of the Howard government was abolished by those on that side of the House and, in doing so, they celebrated its abolition in a fit of sanctimonious self-congratulation, only eclipsed by their introduction of the world's biggest carbon tax into this parliament just a few weeks ago. They replaced a proven solution with a series of policy failures and embarrassments that have resulted in catastrophic failure. For years they derided the impact of their failed policies.

These measures will provide the government with the necessary tools to assess asylum seekers irrespective of their mode of arrival in Australia through an effective and coherent protection processing system. The bill provides legislative support for decision makers who assess the claims of people seeking protection in this country. The measures in this bill clarify lines of responsibility—it is up to the person seeking protection in Australia to establish their identity and their claims to protection in good faith and as soon as possible.

When I was on Christmas Island I was very pleased to see that those reviews, inquiries, recommendations and policy changes that were made in 2006 have been taken up and are making the major practical difference on Christmas Island. I asked about what practical changes had been implemented as a result of the policies announced by the new government and the answer was ‘effectively nothing’ practical—that the practical changes that had been introduced were as a result of the 2006 changes. One thing I commend the department on very highly is that they themselves have a culture of continuous improvement in their management of the detention centres. The department and those who run those centres take their responsibilities very seriously, regardless of which party is in government, and they do the best job they can. Equally, I think the contractor on the ground, Serco, is doing an excellent job.",

The recommendations we have taken are to strengthen the posturing, positioning and resources of Operation Sovereign Borders, as required by those who advised us to do so. Secondly, we have commenced the process of reopening Christmas Island—as recommended we do—to deal with any possible future arrivals as well as any transfers that may now take place. I have also asked the home affairs department to provide advice on the implementation of the measures that were set out in the parliament yesterday and were voted upon, moved and supported by the Labor Party in defiance of the national security advice that they were very well aware of.",

That is the sort of service we want to run on our borders—one that is funded to do the job of protecting our borders. It is of great concern to me that the savings and cuts that were applied to Australian Customs and Border Protection Service by the previous government over their term in office were in excess of $750 million. That is an enormous cut to the budget of the Customs and Border Protection Service. The organisation had 5,700 officers and staff when the previous government came to office; there are 5,000 now; and, on the current forward estimates, they will go to a figure, we estimate, of 4,400. The previous government cut this agency and cut this agency and cut this agency. All they seemed to want to do with this agency was use it to raise revenue, and that is why they came forward with this measure.",

And the minister at the table took a keen interest in this issue when the boundaries of his own electorate somehow extended to Darwin at the 2010 election when 'the good admiral', as we know him, went up there spruik his claims. The commissioner's report also suggested that the minister for immigration and his office have tried to influence and delay the release of sensitive political information relating to Labor's border protection chaos—which continues to this day. There have been 40 boats and over 2,100 people this month—a record failure that has no equal by any government or any Prime Minister.",

That was the record of the previous government when it came to offshore processing. Year after year after year in opposition the coalition said, 'You need to restore offshore processing,' and year after year after year the then government denied it. They said: 'You shouldn't do it; it won't have an outcome; it won't help.' They also said you could not turn back boats and temporary protection visas should not be implemented. They still believe the latter two despite the success of our operations, particularly those at sea.

A lot has changed since then and, frankly, a lot has changed as to how the refugee convention is now contorted and interpreted and used—whether it is by advocates or by the smugglers themselves—and how it is interpreted in the courts, which I think goes well beyond the original intention of that document which was signed by the Menzies government. That is a debate that I am sure will continue. That is a debate the coalition participated in and one we have expressed great reservations over.

This is not offshore processing; it is preventing entry to Australia. Secondly, there is offshore processing in a third country—namely, Nauru—subject to the clear protections we have always stood by. Thirdly, there are temporary protection visas for illegal arrivals who are found to be genuine refugees, but it denies them access to the family reunion program.",

But when it comes to their union mates they cannot get a bill into this place fast enough and seek to ram it through at every opportunity, even in the dying days of this 43rd Parliament. No request from the union movement to this government is too small for them to act upon, as if it was the most urgent issue facing the nation, because this is a government which have completely sold out to the demands of the union movement in the area of immigration policy and engaged in this grubby attack on skilled migrants to this country. They should be ashamed of themselves.",

The coalition significantly increased skilled migration when we were in government, so any increase in skilled migration is also always welcome.

I would have thought he might have, because he is, I am sure, spending quite a bit of time trying to land a deal in Malaysia which, almost seven weeks later, has not yet been completed. My questions relate to that arrangement, and specifically to the funds that have been set aside in the budget. I refer to page 17 of the portfolio additional statements regarding administered expenses, and the item 'Regional Cooperation Framework—Transfer of Irregular Maritime Arrivals to Malaysia', which provides for $65.7 million to be spent over four years in output class 4.3. Can the minister provide a breakdown of the amounts to be paid to the UNHCR, the IOM, any other NGOs and the Malaysian government and any agencies of that government, as well as the purpose of these payments—in other words, what are these payments paying for?",

By November, they realised they were probably a bit out and they thought, ‘Well, we think that 1,400 people are going to arrive this year.’ When they disclosed that at Senate estimates, 2,600 people had already arrived illegally by boat. They asked for an extra $132 million to deal with this increase in arrivals of 1,400 people. However, in just making up the shortfall to now, there are around 3,100 people who have arrived this year and the projection for the full financial year, based on the average, means they will have to add another $250 million to that total this year alone. When you take that out over the three forward years of estimates and you add it to this year, it means that the cost of this government’s failed border protection policy on the budget and over the forward estimates is $1 billion.",

I seek to point that out this afternoon by running through the 'make it up as you go along' policies of the Labor government as they apply to border protection. We know that, when Labor came to power, they abolished the Howard government measures that had been so successful. I note that recently the former Prime Minister the member for Griffith, when pressed on this during a seminar he was addressing, said that the voters made him do it. It was not his decision; they made him do it, because he had promised it. So he blamed the voters for his decision to abolish the measures. And I noticed last night that Senator Evans says he still feels proud of his decisions as the minister for immigration who abolished the Pacific solution. I hope he is proud of the consequences of those decisions. We all know of the chaos, cost and tragedy that followed those decisions. If that minister is going to be proud of those decisions, he must own the consequences that flow from them.",

It will mean that even persons who arrive on Australian soil, on the mainland, by boat will be subject to removal to an offshore processing country and will be processed according to that regime. This bill will effectively excise the Australian mainland from the Migration Act, and the government say it is intended to act as a disincentive to people to make the journey to Australia.

And when you remove those protections, those on this side of the House, who believe in offshore processing and offshore protections, say that those measures should be replaced by other legally binding protections. The only objective, legally binding protection that can be used as a litmus test for this parliament to give instructions to the executive as to which countries and which places they could send people is whether a country is a signatory to the refugee convention. There are 148 countries who have signed that convention. That includes the Philippines, that includes Nauru, that includes Papua New Guinea, and that includes many other countries.",

It was chaos, it was cost and it was tragic. That was the result of the alternative approaches and the experiment.",

Since this Prime Minister was appointed, not elected, 8,500 people have turned up on 131 boats. She said she was going to smash the people smugglers' business model. Well, they have made $80 million on her watch with 8,500 people turning up over the term of her Prime Ministership. What have taxpayers had to foot the bill for while people smugglers on her watch have made $80 million? They have had to foot the bill for blowouts of $3.9 billion.

These are very legitimate and reasonable concerns. This motion put forward by the member for Mayo, who I commend for his advocacy in this parliament on behalf his community, is simply designed to give people a say and to force this government not simply and arrogantly to impose decisions on a community. It is because of their failures, and let us not forget that they are their failures that have created the need for this facility. More beds and a never-never solution in East Timor are no solution. What this government needs is to put a real solution on the table for their border protection failures. The minister should come into the House this week before the parliament rises and stump up with his plan. I am ready to put mine forward and the people of Australia can decide. ",

This day has been a long time coming. In 2010 the governor of Manus Island wrote to the Prime Minister—and Papua New Guinea—and said that he was very happy, and that that state was very happy, to have Papua New Guinea, and particularly Manus Island, host the reopening of an offshore processing facility. That was more than 20,000 arrivals ago. The governor of Manus Island made it very clear that they were happy to restore this facility.",

Most fundamentally, these failings and these mistruths appear in one of the most important documents the government publish each year, and that is their own budget. In the budget this year, for 2010-11, the government came in here and asked for $471 million for asylum seeker management. That is a lot of money—and it is certainly a lot more money than they asked for the previous year, which was around $170 million. What was more troubling was that they said that this was only going to be in order to accommodate some 2,000 arrivals this financial year. That figure was exceeded by about December in this financial year, if not earlier. The government then came back into this place for their own budget most recently and asked for another $290 million, on top of the $470 million, to pay for the blow-out in their costs due to the failure of their policy of asylum seeker management in this country. It is now costing $760 million in the additional estimates.",

It is clear that the people smugglers will continue to make hay while the Gillard sun of failed policy continues to shine on their activities. This year we have had an all-time record of 122 boats and counting—double last year’s number—and this continues to fill the Gillard government’s trophy cabinet of policy failures: most boats in a month, most boats in a financial year, most boats in a calendar year.",

They noticed straightaway, and 92 boats later the verdict is in—that is, the government’s policies have failed. Labor’s answer is to blame others and wind back the regime they inherited that was working, and now their answer is to bring people onshore and thereby dismantle the universal policy of offshore processing that was so successful under the Howard government. That policy will also go to the sword under this government, and what we will see as a result of that is a further escalation. Last summer we had four boats, and this year, in the quiet period, the monsoon period—not even the forces of nature can stop this government’s failures in border protection—we got to around 30 boats over summer.

The reason we have had that success is that we have been adamant that, on every occasion that may present, we will apply all of the policies we have to ensure that no venture successfully reaches Australia. Those are the policies that we are applying, whether it is in this instance or in any other instance. I know that those opposite like to denigrate the fact that there has been no successful people-smuggling venture to Australia in seven months, but it means that there has been no loss of life for people at sea as a result of those ventures since last September.",

Instead of seeking to shore up our border protection regime, having heard this advice in the face of these threats, this government did the opposite. They followed through with the closure of Nauru. They abolished temporary protection visas. They gave people smugglers back a product to sell. The policy of turning boats back, promised by this government prior to 2007, they reversed and the long-held universal offshore processing regime soon became a thing of the past.

In this year’s budget they assume 4,500 people will be coming to Australia—having forecast in the budget a year ago that only 200 people would come. So far this year 5,352 people have come and the year is not out yet.  This means that the government is forecasting a drop in illegal boat arrivals of more than 60 per cent in 2010-11. According to the budget presented in the House by this government a month ago, in just a few weeks time we are going to have a 60 per cent decline in the number of people coming illegally by boat to this country. It is no wonder that in estimates Senator Evans, the minister responsible, said, ‘I am not very confident that we can with any surety say that the 2,000 figure that is used for the accounting purpose in that budget paper can be supported.’ He does not believe it. He does not believe his own budget papers.",

That side of the House is the only political party and government that has introduced, while I have been in this House, a discriminatory immigration policy in this country.

That is an increase that this government is asking this parliament for of 106 per cent—a 106 per cent increase in expenditure in this area, over and above the budget. What that actually means in terms of how much the government will be spending this year compared to last year is an increase of $144 million—or an increase of 126 per cent over what was spent on these matters in 2008-09. Just to put that in total terms, the government is now asking to spend $257,429,000 this year on the issue of offshore processing, compared to an actual figure for 2008-09 of $113,778,000. This is the cost in financial terms of the government’s failed border protection policies. This is what happens when you create a highway on the sea to Christmas Island, which has become a visa factory under this government.",

John Howard and his government did everything that was necessary to ensure that Australia’s borders were protected. As a result, our borders were protected.

Neither Whitlam nor Fraser ever resiled from the positions they took at that time, yet ultimately they came to see the good in each other. Some years ago, Whitlam observed with characteristic wit that 'Fraser had supplanted him as the principal bogeyman of the hard Right and that this second usurpation had been easier to take than the first'. A sense grew, especially among Liberals, that the Fraser government might have marked time. In the late eighties and the early nineties Malcolm Fraser offered himself to be federal president of the Liberal Party, and twice it did not work out. As the Howard government implemented reforms such as the GST and privatisation, expanded mandatory detention to stop the boats and joined US-led military coalitions in Afghanistan and Iraq, an estrangement grew between him and the party he had led for eight years—for most of that time triumphantly.",

Remember: this amendment guarantees offshore processing, but it guarantees offshore processing with the protection that it must take place in a country which is a signatory to the UN refugee convention. Our amendment secures offshore processing, but it also does the best we can to secure human decency and to protect human rights, subject to the kind of legal certainty that the government now thinks is necessary in the wake of the High Court decision. If the government fails to accept our amendment, we will have no choice but to oppose the legislation. The likelihood is that, on the basis of that opposition, the legislation will fail to pass through the parliament. That will mean that the government has no capacity in its assessment to send people offshore. That is not an assessment that this coalition shares. We believe that, even under the existing legislation, offshore processing at Nauru is possible and desirable.",

Now she says that temporary protection visas are an almost diabolical thing. The Prime Minister said repeatedly that offshore processing, the Pacific solution, was 'costly, unsustainable and wrong in principle'.

What the government had in mind was to completely strip out of the Migration Act the requirement that Philip Ruddock, the member for Berowra, put in there back in 2001 that the countries to which Australia sent people had to observe relevant human rights standards.

Those 160 to 220 guns are enough to fight a street battle. They are enough to sustain a gangland war. They are enough to terrorise our streets. It is happening because of this government's incompetence in maintaining proper border protection: not just border protection against illegal boats, but border protection against illegal guns. This is why standing orders must be suspended. This is why this motion should take priority.",
